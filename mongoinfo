Install mongo on mac:
    https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

After installation, you can run a local mongo daemon, by running the command
    mongod

which looks like

Nans-MacBook-Air:templates njiang$ mongod
2016-02-04T20:57:01.894-0500 I CONTROL  [initandlisten] MongoDB starting : pid=8388 port=27017 dbpath=/data/db 64-bit host=Nans-MacBook-Air.local
2016-02-04T20:57:01.895-0500 I CONTROL  [initandlisten] db version v3.2.1
2016-02-04T20:57:01.895-0500 I CONTROL  [initandlisten] git version: a14d55980c2cdc565d4704a7e3ad37e4e535c1b2

2016-02-04T20:57:18.524-0500 I NETWORK  [initandlisten] connection accepted from 127.0.0.1:52569

In another terminal, you can connect to the db using the mongo shell, just run
   mongo

Quit the db by ctrl+c


Make sure the directory /var/log/mongodb is owned by the user starting the process. If it's not created, create the directory
Run mongo in as a daemon, 
   mongod --fork --logpath /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log

Import a sample DB into your mongo db, player.json is located in src/db/example_dataset
   mongoimport --db appdb --collection players --drop --file player.json

After the import succeeded, you can run a query from terminal
    first, run mongod
        mongod
    This should default to your appdb
    If its not defaulted, use the 'use' command
        use appdb
    Then list out your collections
        show collections
    Should see a players collection

    Now run a query, and find all players thats a carry
        db.players.find( { position : "carry" })
    This should return you the carry players info 
    Try replace carry with support, and nothing will show up

After activating virtualenv (See Readme),  install pymongo for the python mongo lib.  
    pip install pymongo
 
Run the app, and do a submit test, it'll reach back to db and pull out the entry
